Non-Addressable RGB LED Strip Code
========================================

[![Demo of Non-Addressable LED Strip Custom Color](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/3/1/Non-Addressable_RGB_LED_Strip_Custom_Color_Cycling.gif)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/3/1/Non-Addressable_RGB_LED_Strip_Custom_Color_Cycling.gif)

Example code for analog RGB LED strips. Depending on your setup, you can also use this with an individual common cathode or common anode RGB LED. You can also use this if you have an LED driver to control high power RGB LEDs.
